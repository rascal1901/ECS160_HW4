The Homework Machine 
Oh the Homework Machine
Most perfect 
contraption that's ever been seen.
Just put in your homework then drop in a dime
Snap on the switch and in ten seconds' time
Your homework comes out quick and clean as can be.
Here it is
--
"nine plus four?" and the answer is "three."
Three?
Oh me . . .
I guess it's not as perfect
As I thought it would be.
